# Background / Project Overview
Cyclisticâ€™s Customer Growth Team is preparing a business plan for next year. The objective is to understand how customers use Cyclistic bikes, with a priority on identifying demand across station locations. A BI dashboard will summarize trip records, helping the team make informed decisions about where to expand stations and how to optimize operations.

## Key Business Questions Addressed
* How can customer usage insights inform new station growth?
* Which starting and ending station locations are most in demand?
* How do trip patterns vary by time of day, season, and weather?
* Which factors (location, time, season, weather, subscription type) most impact customer demand?
* How does year-over-year trip growth compare across stations?
* Where does congestion occur, and how might new stations alleviate it?
